        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:** Master CNN architecture and build production-ready image classification systems using PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Topics Covered:**\n",
        "- CNN architecture: convolution, pooling, and feature learning\n",
        "- Building CNNs from scratch with PyTorch\n",
        "- Image preprocessing and data augmentation\n",
        "- Training CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets\n",
        "- Feature visualization and model interpretation\n",
        "- Advanced techniques: batch normalization, dropout, residual connections\n",
        "- Transfer learning fundamentals\n",
        "- Real-world applications and industry best practices\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-World Impact:** CNNs power everything from medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles, social media filters to security systems. By the end of today, you'll understand the technology behind these applications and be able to build your own image recognition systems.\n",
